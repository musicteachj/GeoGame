User has 3 in-game days to find the burglar "Carlos San Francisco" after he has commited a crime.

Everytime the user moves to a new location, the time it takes to reach the destination will  be subtracted from the 3 day countdown clock.

Once the user thinks they are in the correct location, they will need to zoom in on the map and try to find Carlos somewhere in that city.

Hint for developers: The starting location is logged to the console.
